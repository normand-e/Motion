        <h1>Mountains</h1>
        <p>A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. ... Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers.</p>
